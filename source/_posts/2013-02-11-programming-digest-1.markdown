The quote accurately explains what this post about. The author gives great mental and
technical tips about interviewing process (not only in Google).
Big portion of motivation guaranteed, perhaps you man feel dumber after reading.

In few words, you must know: algorithm complexity, sorting, hashtables, trees,
graphs, other data structures, math, operating systems and at least one programming language very well.
Not bad, right? After reading that article I've build long-term learning plan for myself, which is still
not succesful. Great article.

### 2. [A Gentle Introduction to Algorithm Complexity Analysis](http://discrete.gr/complexity/)

This article helps you partially cover first thing from previous article: *algorithm complexity*.
By the way it is written with understandable *for programmers* language, examples, pictures, excerpts - I like
such style.

After reading, you'll understand what time/space complexity is, difference between *Theta* and *Big-O* notations,
recursive functions complexity and lot more. By the way, you will learn basic classes of time complexities, and get
skill to classify that complexities on O(n), O(n^2 ), O(n*logn), etc. Note, the articles consists of some excercises, which immediately followed
with solutions. It is more productive to solve this exercises by yourselves and then compare to solutions.
