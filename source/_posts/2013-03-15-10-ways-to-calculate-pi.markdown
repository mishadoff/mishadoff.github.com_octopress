March 14 is known as `3/14` in American date format. On that day matematicians
celebrate [Pi Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day). This article shows some
ways how to get π value.

### 1. Google It

[I really mean it](https://www.google.com.ua/#hl=uk&sclient=psy-ab&q=pi+&oq=pi+&gs_l=hp.3..35i39l2j0l2.10136.10136.2.10444.1.1.0.0.0.0.159.159.0j1.1.0.eappsweb.1.0.0...1.1.6.psy-ab.RI6oyGPVWMo&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.43828540,d.ZWU&fp=9cd9038a636332fc&biw=1280&bih=600)

### 2. Mnemonic Rule

To remember the numbers people often build associations.
For example, mnemonic rules for $\pi$ help to restore its digits
by counting number of letters in each word:

> How I wish I could calculate pi

`3 1 4 1 5 9 2`

> How I like a drink, alcoholic of course,
> after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics

`3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9 7 9`

### 3. Approximation

There is a lot of rational
[approximations of π](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80).
Most famous one is $22 \over 7$ and it yields `3.1428`. Rough enough.

If you want to get more accurate results, move along:
$333 \over 106$, $355 \over 113$, $2383784714 \over 758782241$
and even crazy one:

$$
{ln(5280^3 \cdot (236674 + 30303 \sqrt{61})^3 + 744)} \over {\sqrt{427}}
$$

### 4. Circle and Rope

![PICTURE]()

* Draw a big circle with radius $r$.
* Use thin rope to cover circumference.
* Find the used length of rope `L`.

Using the circumference formula $2\pi r$ we get value of $\pi$:

$$
\pi = {L \over {2r}}
$$

You need ultra-thin rope, eagle eye, extra-big circle and extra-accurate ruler.

### 5. Experiment: Circle, Square and Coin

![PICTURE]()

* Draw a circle with some radius $r$. The square of circle is known
as $\pi r^2$.
* Limit circle with square with some size $a, a \geq 2r$. Its square is $a^2$.
* Experiment step: drop a random *something small* (a coin) on your drawings.
If it inside square, increment `N` value. If it inside circle increment `M` value.

More coin drops you perform, more accurate result you get!

### 6. Experiment: Stick and Lines

![TODO]()

* Have sticks with length $m$
* Draw lines with the distance $m$ between them.
* Drop stick, count crossed

### 7. Something
