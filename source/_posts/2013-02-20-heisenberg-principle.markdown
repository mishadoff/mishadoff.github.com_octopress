It is so obvious, so I decided to write about it.

[Heisenberg principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle)
came from quantum mechanics and means that you can't know exactly
both coordinates and speed of particle. If you improve accuracy of detecting
position, you lose accuracy in detecting speed and vice versa. *Uncertain* stuff.

In human-readable form it sounds like

> Either one or the other

The same in every field, even in software engineering.
If you implementing something or fixing bugs and your boss
yelling: "you must work [better and faster](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjR4_CbPpQ)"
tell him *either one or the other*.

**P.S.** Actually, you can say "go fuck yourself", but it won't be polite.
