``` perl
($current_tasks, $perl) = ($perl, $current_tasks);
```

Long time learning [perl](http://www.perl.org/) was my desire.
Now I pushed back for a little some of my activities, and started with perl.

<!-- more -->

The reason for this was the third launch of [Stanford Cryptography](https://class.coursera.org/crypto-004/class/index) class on coursera.

Cryptography is a field that I never know, but would like to. I see a lot of practical applications here,
but, honestly, for me it's more *just for fun*, than anything else. Isn't it interesting to (de)cypher something?

First two launches was marked as lack of time for me, so I postponed it. By the way, other interesting courses was *in progress*.
But now I really hope that I get enough time (*and patience*) to finish the class and get some good knowledge in this field.

I don't know why, but I choose perl as primary language for doing programming assignments.

First of all, I needed some fast scripting language for general-purpose problems. To choose between perl and python, I choose perl.
Because of *"less number of symbols in the name"*, of course. Second of all, I don't know perl and it's a good reason to learn it *in action*.
Also, what is important, I did get only positive reviews from my friends who know perl, but all their stories was like a mistery for me.
Thought, that only chosen one can learn perl. I want to dispel this myth. To try, at least.

The book that I choose for learning is a classic book (*read Perl Bible*) from the creator of perl, [Larry Wall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall).
There is fresh, 4th edition, available.

Hope, I won't stop at the middle of something and get useful tool for *everyday problems*.
