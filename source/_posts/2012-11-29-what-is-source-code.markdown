It's not just a bunch of `ifs` and `fors` you mastering every day.
It's not even `Factories`, `Builders` and `Proxies` you learn from [GoF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns).

I think this term has much wider meaning.

*Almost everything you can create is source code.*

By creation I mean creation in digital world, not building the house.
Good criteria of source code - is something that may be changed and need to be up-to-date.

[Article](https://github.com/WiredEnterprise/Lord-of-the-Files) - source code,
[Blog](https://github.com/mishadoff/mishadoff.github.com) - source code,
[Book](https://github.com/patmorin/ods) - source code,
[Configuration](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d) - source code,
[Laws](https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze) - source code,
[Dating request](https://github.com/norinori2222/boyfriend_require/blob/master/README-en.md) is also source code.

The word `code` can be confusing, but it is not.

**Code** - is just a set of instructions that can be processed by *processor*.

From that point of view, processor is our brain.

And if you really appreciate your *source code*, choose appropriate control version system for it.
