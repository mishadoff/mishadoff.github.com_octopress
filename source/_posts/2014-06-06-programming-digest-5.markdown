Programming Sucks.

<!-- more -->

### 1. [Programming Sucks](http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks)

> ...many of the programs you depend on are written by dicks and idiots

Funny ranting about crazy programming life.

> Every programmer occasionally, when nobody's home, turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their computer...This file is Good Code.

### 2. [Functional Programming For The Rest Of Us](http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html)

There are two types of people in functional programming world:
those who use monads and those who don't know they use monads.

This is a good overview that helps to convince your colleague to use fp without monads, applicative functors and other theoretical shit.

### 3. [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)

A set of patterns and techniques applicable to game development. Probably some of them you've already used. Unfortunately, examples in C++. 

### 4. [A Hacker's Guide to Git](http://wildlyinaccurate.com/a-hackers-guide-to-git)

Pour some light on git internals. Seems like almost everything in git is just a hashcode.

### 5. [Is TDD Dead?](http://martinfowler.com/articles/is-tdd-dead/)

Hangouts with Martin Fowler, Kent Beck and David Heinemeier Hansson about TDD. Do not test everything.

### 6. [Character Encodings](http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/25/character-encodings-for-modern-programmers/)

A history and caveats of encodings. Windows sucks.

### 7. [Principles Of High Performance Programs](http://blog.libtorrent.org/2012/12/principles-of-high-performance-programs/)

Generic useful rules you may consider when building high-performance applications. Memory latency, context switch, granularity and other things explained.

### 8. [Software Talks for the Ages](http://pchristensen.com/blog/articles/software-talks-for-the-ages/)

Meta one. Good set of programming talks.
[50 in 50](http://vimeo.com/25958308) is a pure gold.

### 9. [How the CPU works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNN_tTXABUA)

This is quite interesting.

### 10. [2 + 2 = 5](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/28786/write-a-program-that-makes-2-2-5)

Stackoverflow discussion with examples how to write a program that makes `2+2=5`.

> That. Is. Evil.
