Finally decided to post here my solutions to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) implemented in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).

<!-- more -->

As all in my life, frequency of posts with solutions will be mood-dependent.

The main reason for this series to provide a little introduction to clojure programming language during the solving interesting problems.

I'll also try do my best to explain some general terms, why this approach better or worse than others,
suggest alternative solutions or thoughts on problem and provide code.
You allowed to copy that code, calculate the result and past answer directly in Project Euler site, but I don't see any sense to do this.
Problem solving process gives more fun, than result. Approximately [2.718282](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28mathematical_constant%29) times more.
