<h3>1. <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html">Get that job at Google</a></h3>

<blockquote><p>...it's highly likely that someone on the loop will be unimpressed with you,
even if you are Alan Turing. Especially if you're Alan Turing,
in fact, since it means you obviously don't know C++</p></blockquote>

<p>The quote accurately explains what this post about. The author gives great mental and
technical tips about interviewing process (not only in Google).
Big portion of motivation guaranteed, perhaps you man feel dumber after reading.</p>

<p>In few words, you must know: algorithm complexity, sorting, hashtables, trees,
graphs, other data structures, math, operating systems and at least one programming language very well.
Not bad, right? After reading that article I've build long-term learning plan for myself, which is still
not succesful. Great article.</p>

<h3>2. <a href="http://discrete.gr/complexity/">A Gentle Introduction to Algorithm Complexity Analysis</a></h3>

<p>This article helps you partially cover first thing from previous article: <em>algorithm complexity</em>.
By the way it is written with understandable <em>for programmers</em> language, examples, pictures, excerpts - I like
such style.</p>

<p>After reading, you'll understand what time/space complexity is, difference between <em>Theta</em> and <em>Big-O</em> notations,
recursive functions complexity and lot more. By the way, you will learn basic classes of time complexities, and get
skill to classify that complexities on O(n), O(n<sup>2),</sup> O(n*logn), etc. Note, the articles consists of some excercises, which immediately followed
with solutions. It is more productive to solve this exercises by yourselves and then compare to solutions.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I come up with idea to share my favorite articles I found
on the internet and give basic description for them.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I do not plan this <em>digest</em> as periodical thing,
so the first pattern I found appropriate is to publish this as soon
as I have ten articles marked as <em>favorite</em> somewhere.</p>

<p>That's the rule: <strong>each post - 10 articles</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Favorite</em> means <em>really favorite</em>, so I do not crosspost every article I've read.</p>

<p>Hard to say what topics will be covered.
I call it <em>programming digest</em> because most of articles will be somehow
related to programming, but do not blame me if you see articles with another
topic (math or humour), believe me they can be interesting also.</p>

<p>By the way, a lot of articles may be old, even very old (<em>don't call me Necromancer</em>)
but if they appear here, I found them somehow relevant and important to post.</p>

<p>Hope, you'll find such sort of digest is interesting for reading and I like if you
share your favorite <em>programming-related</em> articles with me.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
