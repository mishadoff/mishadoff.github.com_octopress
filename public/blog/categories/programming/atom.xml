</code></p>

<p>Idea behind this problem is pretty straightforward:</p>

<ol>
<li>Init <code>maximum</code> with some small value, zero would be good.</li>
<li>Take first 5 digits, calculate the product.</li>
<li>If product is greater than our current <code>maximum</code>, reassign it.</li>
<li>Shift, to take other 5 digits, and back to the step 1.</li>
</ol>


<p>A simple optimization can be applied: if our last element of 5 digit group is zero,
then skip 5 shifts. But it's details.</p>

<p>Let's make our problem little harder to get more from clojure.</p>

<p>Assume that these digits stored in the file. First thing we need: to read the file.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(slurp "path/to/the/file")
</code></p>

<p><a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/slurp">slurp</a> is the simplest
function to read file content (<em>In fact, not only files</em>).
It just returns string representation of the whole file.</p>

<p>Then we need to break one large string into symbols.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(seq "helloyo") =&gt; (\h \e \l \l \o \y \o)
</code></p>

<p><a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/seq">seq</a> return a sequence with linear access
to collection. If applied to string, return sequence of characters.</p>

<p>But, there are some garbage in the file we don't want, new lines for example.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(remove #(= \newline %) [\h \e \l \l \o \newline \y \o])
</code></p>

<p>(<em>slash</em>) + something - represents character in clojure.
<code>\newline</code> is a new line, known as <code>\n</code> in other languages.</p>

<p>Now we have long sequence with all digits from file.
Need to get all consecutive groups with 5 letters.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(partition 5 1 [\h \e \l \l \o \y \o]) =&gt; [[\h \e \l \l \o] [\e \l \l \o \y] ... ]
</code></p>

<p><a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/partition">partition</a>
is an excelent function for such tasks. We specify <code>5</code> - size of partition,
and <code>1</code> shift size. It generates all consecutive groups with 5 elements till the end.</p>

<p>Calulating the product for each group gives us the solution.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(reduce * [1 2 3 4])
</code></p>

<p>Not so fast.</p>

<p>You, probably, get <code>ClassCastException</code>.</p>

<p>After reading the file, we just get bunch of characters,
instead of digits in mathematical sense. And applied mathematical operation <code>*</code> to them.
So, simply speaking, <code>\1</code> is not <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>That's why we need to transform every digit character to it's actual digit value.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(map #(- (int %) 48) [\1 \2 \3]) =&gt; [1 2 3]
</code></p>

<p>This awful implementation do the work.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cast each character to int, get the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a>
representation for digit.</li>
<li>From each ASCII value we subtract <code>48</code> and get digit value.</li>
</ul>


<p>Applying <code>product</code> of digits defined earlier we get solution to this problem.</p>

<p>Again, full code on <a href="https://github.com/mishadoff/project-euler/blob/master/src/project_euler/problem008.clj">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> <code>slurp</code> function very powerful and has may applications. You can specify encoding
for reading as you want or read whole html page by url. But it is also very dangerous function,
because reads all file contents to the memory and can take considerable amount of time. If you have
a large file, say 15GB, read it line by line with buffered reader. Also, note
<a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/spit">spit</a> function. It is opposite to <code>slurp</code> -
writes string to the file.</p>

<p>It's also pretty clear problem to make you more familiar with prime numbers.
As I said in <a href="/blog/clojure-euler-problem-003">Clojure Euler: Problem 003</a>,
big amount of Project Euler problems devoted to prime numbers so it is <strong>MUST HAVE</strong> (<em>I don't like this phrase either</em>)</p>

<p>You need to implement by yourself effective prime number algorithm. And only after that use one from library.
As we do.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(:use [clojure.contrib.lazy-seqs :only (primes)])
</code></p>

<p>This line import just one symbol <code>primes</code> to your namespace. It's a prime numbers lazy sequence. Lazy sequences briefly covered
in <a href="/blog/clojure-euler-problem-002">Clojure Euler: Problem 002</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">Wikipedia article</a>,
that's enough for now.</p>

<p>Return to question.</p>

<blockquote><p>What is the 10001st prime number?</p></blockquote>

<p>No problem.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(last (take 10001 primes))
</code></p>

<p>Two lines of code: one for import, one for solution. What can be simpler?</p>

<p>Note, that <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/last">last</a> return last element of the sequence and works in linear time.</p>

<p>Another one problem solved in few <strike>seconds</strike> minutes.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mishadoff/project-euler/blob/master/src/project_euler/problem007.clj">GitHub</a></p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Actually, I lied. In linked solution I use 6 lines of code: namespace declaration, use, <em>empty line</em>,
comment with executing time, function declaration and, finally, solution.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every experienced java programmer should know that <code>finally</code> block always executed. But is it true?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It depends on our definition of program execution. But, generally speaking, <strong>yes</strong>.</p>

<h3>Normal program execution</h3>

<p><em>Aha, look at this</em>, someone might retort:</p>

<p><code>java
try {
  System.exit(1);
} finally {
  System.out.println("I'm here, man");
}
</code></p>

<p><em>You just said, finally block always executed?</em></p>

<p>Well. In that case no, because we speaking about normal flow of program execution.
This is <em>abnormal</em>.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/finally.html">official tutorial</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Note: If the JVM exits while the try or catch code is being executed, then the finally block may not execute.</p></blockquote>

<p>Your counter question might be: <em>If second line of that code always exectued?</em></p>

<p><code>java
System.out.println("Line 1");
System.out.println("Line 2");
System.out.println("Line 3");
</code></p>

<p>Sure, because it's linear flow. Nothing can break...<strong>BANG</strong>...<code>Electricity unavailable. Program stopped.</code></p>

<p>What about this? It's also abnormal program execution, and we can't guarantee anything for 100%.
In fact, this is the same as <code>System.exit(1)</code> or <code>reset</code> button on your computer or whatever.</p>

<p>That's why, we are talking about <em>normal</em> program execution. Only <em>normal</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I said yes? I meant no!</p></blockquote>

<h3>Perpetuum Mobile</h3>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<p>``` java
try {
  while (true) {</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println("I print here some useful information");
</code></pre>

<p>  }
} finally {
  System.out.println("Let me run");
}
```</p>

<p>Will be the line <em>"Let me run"</em> printed? Maybe yes, if printing error to standard output appear. Almost always the answer is no.</p>

<p>In that case, there are no difference between simple statement and finally block. None of them will be executed, throw this example away.</p>

<h3>Threads</h3>

<p>What about threads? We know that execution flow controlled by threads and they can be interrupted.</p>

<p>Assume that we have thread that perform some work, and other thread kills first one right before finally block. Finally wasn't executed.</p>

<p>Assume that we have deadlock between two threads, right before finally line. The same thing.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/finally.html">same tutorial</a></p>

<blockquote><p>...if the thread executing the try or catch code is interrupted or killed, the finally block may not execute even though the application as a whole continues.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, we can treat thread like a program, and make one effective rule:</p>

<p><strong>Rule 1</strong>. Finally executes always, except the case where controlling program or thread was aborted.</p>

<h3>Finally we return</h3>

<p>Ok, now we know when finally is not executed. But do we know when finally is executed?</p>

<p>Consider the example:</p>

<p>``` java
int someFunc() {
  try {</p>

<pre><code>return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>  } finally {</p>

<pre><code>return 1;
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>The result is obviously <code>1</code>. Just because <code>finally</code> is always executed.</p>

<p>Consider, next example:</p>

<p>``` java
int someFunc() {
  try {</p>

<pre><code>throw new RuntimeException();
</code></pre>

<p>  } finally {</p>

<pre><code>return 1;
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>The result is <code>1</code> again. And it's a problem. We just lose the exception.
Such issue known as <em>exception swallowing</em>. It is very dangerous, because client's code expect either exception or some value, but it always get only value.</p>

<p>One more less imaginary example.</p>

<p>``` java
String deposit(int amount) throws DAOException {
  try {</p>

<pre><code>return dao.deposit(amount);
</code></pre>

<p>  } finally {</p>

<pre><code>return "OK";
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>The logic behind <code>finally</code> is to have some default value, and our <code>deposit</code> method throws the <code>DAOException</code> where client code is
responsible for its handling. Unfortunately, perhaps compiler forces you to handle this <code>DAOException</code> it never occurs. And string "OK" will be returned.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 2</strong>. Never use <code>return</code> from <code>finally</code> block.</p>

<h3>Instead of conclusion</h3>

<p>A lot of programmers are aware about this common mistake. But some are not.
Maybe these two simple rules give you a tiny light on coward <code>finally</code>.</p>

<p>This problem is very simple, even simpler than previous one, that confirms fact that all Project Euler problems
are <strong>NOT</strong> in increasing complexity order. Ok, let's split our problem into two subproblems.</p>

<h3>Sum of the squares</h3>

<p>First, we need a square function:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defn sqr [n] (* n n))
</code></p>

<p>Then, sum of squares of the first one hundred natural numbers we calculate with common <code>(reduce + list)</code> idiom:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(reduce + (map sqr (range 1 101)))
</code></p>

<h3>Square of the sum</h3>

<p>Just take a sum, and square it:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(sqr (reduce + (range 1 101)))
</code></p>

<h3>Bind all together</h3>

<p>We splitted our problem into two smaller, now is time to bind all. We can just subtract results obtained
but you see, that both of smaller solutions uses common piece of code <code>(range 1 101)</code>. Move it to <code>let</code> form.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(let [rn (range 1 101)]
  (- (sqr (reduce + rn)) (reduce + (map sqr rn)))))
</code></p>

<p>That' all. I've got result in less than millisecond.
Maybe there are some pitfalls in this problem (<em>e.g. integer overflow for larger ranges</em>)
but this most straightforward solution works fine.</p>

<p>Congratulations!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mishadoff/project-euler/blob/master/src/project_euler/problem006.clj">GitHub</a></p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> First time I solved this problem and was confused: <em>Where is the trick?</em> Seems nowhere.
That's why using most straightforward solution is often the best choice (<em>excluding obvious cases, of course</em>).
It has fast implementation, and if it fails, it fails fast.</p>

<p>What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?</p></blockquote>

<p>Permalink: <a href="http://projecteuler.net/problem=5">http://projecteuler.net/problem=5</a></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It's a tricky problem. First look gives us straightforward solution:
Take a number, test if it evenly divisible by all of needed numbers, if yes - we good,
otherwise increment number and test again, and again, and again...</p>

<p>No, really, assume it's our function to test divisibility by all 20 numbers:</p>

<p>``` clojure
(defn evenly-divisible-by-20? [n]
  (zero? (reduce +</p>

<pre><code>(for [i (range 2 21)]
  (mod n i)))))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Awful implementation, but keeps the idea.
If sum of all remainders equals to zero, then every remainder equals to zero.
Now, using this function we write naive implementation:</p>

<p>``` clojure</p>

<pre><code>(first
  (drop-while #(not (evenly-divisible-by-20? %)) (iterate inc 1)))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Note, function <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/drop-while">drop-while</a>
similar to take-while, but skips values until they meet predicate condition.</p>

<p>Waiting for result? Take a cup of tea and wait a little. Still waiting? Wait a little more...</p>

<p>I did not post exact answer here, but result greater than 100 millions.
And obviously this linear algorithm will work considerable amount of time.
So, stop the execution and let's see at the problem from the other end.</p>

<p><em>What is the smallest number that evenly divisible by 1 and 2?</em>
Obviously 2.</p>

<p><em>What is the smallest number that evenly divisible by 2 and 3?</em>
A bit harder, but answer is 6.</p>

<p><em>What is the smallest number that evenly divisible by 4 and 5?</em>
20.</p>

<blockquote><p>Oh, it's just multiplication</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, no. Take numbers <code>4</code> and <code>6</code>, multiplication gives us <code>24</code> and it will be evenly divisible by <code>4</code> and <code>6</code>, but
this number is not the <em>smallest</em>. Snmallest number for this case will be <code>12</code>.</p>

<p>There is a function, that finds smallest number divisible by 2 different numbers.
This function called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple">Least Common Multiple</a> (<em>lcm</em>).
There are lot of different methods to calculate it, but we will use one that uses
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">Greatest Common Divisor</a> (<em>gcd</em>)</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/b/3/5b3f3c62dd59cc5594af7b2ece3798fb.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Where <em>gcd</em> calculated according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">Euclid's algorithm</a></p>

<p>``` clojure
(defn gcd [n k]
  (loop [a n b k]</p>

<pre><code>(if (zero? b) a (recur b (mod a b)))))
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Using formula above, our <em>lcm</em> function will look like this:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defn lcm [n k]
  (/ (abs (* n k)) (gcd n k)))
</code></p>

<p>You see, here we need <code>abs</code> function. Nothing hard to implement it, but if we remember
<a href="/blog/clojure-euler-problem-004">previous problem</a> there are was a reference
to <code>clojure.contrib.math</code> library. <code>abs</code> there and we can use it, just add to your namespace definition</p>

<p><code>clojure
(:use [clojure.contrib.math])
</code></p>

<p>Oh look, even <code>lcm</code> and <code>gcd</code> functions there. Excellent.</p>

<p>Now we can solve the problem. Remember the <code>reduce</code> function?</p>

<p><code>clojure
(reduce lcm (range 1 21))
</code></p>

<p>Actually, this one-liner is solution. And it gives us correct result.</p>

<p>What happens here? We iteratively (<em>with using reduce</em>) find the lcm for <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>,
then for result and <code>3</code>, for result and <code>4</code> and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Great!</strong> One more problem solved!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mishadoff/project-euler/blob/master/src/project_euler/problem005.clj">GitHub</a></p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> One lesson we learned here. Be aware about library functionality. It helps you
to solve problems and avoid coward mistakes. For example, we have incorrect above implementation
for <code>lcm</code> function. If we call <code>(lcm 0 0)</code> program fails with <code>DivideByZero</code> exception.
It still solve our problem, but in future uses can be an additional problem.
But in lib implementation this error is covered. And we can be sure that <em>almost always</em> libs contain much less
errors that your <em>new fancy wheel</em>.</p>
