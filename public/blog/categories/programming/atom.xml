<p>As note says we can try every route and it will be just good.
Instead of that, we can behave much better with clever method.</p>

<p>(Some time ago, I gave basic explanation on my approach in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8002252/euler-project-18-approach">StackOverflow question</a>)</p>

<p>We have example triangle:</p>

<p><code>
       3
      7 4
     2 4 6
    8 5 9 3
</code></p>

<p>Instead of testing each route from top to the bottom, we moving from bottom
to the top and always select the best choice. As we want to find the max sum, we perform addition im place.</p>

<p>Assuming we on the 3rd line (2 4 6).</p>

<p><strong>From 2</strong> we can go either 8 or 5, 8 is better (maximize your sum), then you calculate first
sum <code>8 + 2 = 10</code>.</p>

<p><strong>From 4</strong> we can go either 5 or 9, 9 is better, <code>4 + 9 = 13</code>.</p>

<p><strong>From 6</strong> we can go either 9 or 3, 9 is better, <code>9 + 6 = 15</code>.</p>

<p>Now, we removing last row, because we processed all routes and selected best ones, and replacing
3rd row with calculated sums. Current triangle looks like:</p>

<p><code>
        3
      7  4
    10 13 15
</code></p>

<p>Repeat the same action until we get one number, which will be solution.</p>

<p>Let’s transform this idea to clojure.</p>

<p>First of all we need datastructure to represent triangle.
List of lists would be good:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(def triangle '((3) (7 4) (2 4 6) (8 5 9 3)))
</code></p>

<p>Now we want to know, what direction generates the best sum.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defn max-row [lst]
  (map #(reduce max %) (partition 2 1 lst)))
</code></p>

<p>It breaks list to pairs, and select max from each pair.
For example, <code>[8 5 9 3]</code> we split to <code>[[8 5] [5 9] [9 3]]</code>
and select max from each sublist <code>[8 9 9]</code>.</p>

<p>Just add this list to previous one</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defn step-max [lst1 lst2]
  (map + (max-row lst1) lst2))
</code></p>

<p>One iteration of <code>step-max</code> creates smaller triangle with sums on the bottom row.
But we need only one number.</p>

<p>Correct, <code>reduce</code> is ideal!</p>

<p><code>clojure
(reduce step-max (reverse triangle))
</code></p>

<p>That’s it.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Problem 067 can be solved with the same code.</p>

Naive Bayes Classifier, functional programming and Java 8.</p>

<h3 id="math-for-programmershttpsteve-yeggeblogspotcom200603math-for-programmershtml">1. <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-for-programmers.html">Math For Programmers</a></h3>

<p>Another great post by Steve Yegge about math. Math for developers.
As everyone might to retort, knowing math is not mandatory for software engineering field, but you know:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Math is… ummm, please don’t tell anyone I said this;
I’ll never get invited to another party as long as I live.
But math, well… I’d better whisper this, so listen up: (it’s actually kinda fun.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I totally agree. It’s a lot of fun.
Just read subreddit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/math/">math</a>, even if you don’t understand anything.</p>

<p>Pick your favourite math subject and try to dig more.
Statistics, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math, Combinatorics, Operation Research, Group Theory
and more; one of them can be a good start.</p>

<p>Does that really helps? Well, maybe. But it’s definitely improve your problem solving skill.</p>

<p>And believe. Math makes you a <em>better</em> programmer.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-explained-rest-to-my-wifehttptomaykocomwritingsrest-to-my-wife">2. <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/rest-to-my-wife">How I Explained REST to My Wife</a></h3>

<p>Good article about how web works. I found it very useful for understanding
some parts I thought I understood. By the way, great examples.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ryan: I can’t drive a cup and I can’t drink a car. But some verbs are almost universal like GET, PUT, and DELETE.</p>

  <p>Wife: You can’t DELETE a cup.</p>

  <p>Ryan: Well, okay, but you can throw it away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, author of this article take it down due to lot of complaints about
article gender-oriented nature. I don’t think it’s offensive and here is the link with

<p>Do you think you are great programmer? Test yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Algorithms</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>2^n (Level 0)</strong>. Unable to find the average of numbers in an array
(It’s hard to believe but I’ve interviewed such candidates)</li>
  <li><strong>n^2 (Level 1)</strong>. Basic sorting, searching and data structure traversal and retrieval algorithms</li>
  <li><strong>n (Level 2)</strong>. Tree, Graph, simple greedy and divide and conquer algorithms, is able to understand
the relevance of the levels of this matrix.</li>
  <li><strong>log(n) (Level 3)</strong>. Able to recognize and code dynamic programming solutions, good knowledge of graph algorithms,
good knowledge of numerical computation algorithms, able to identify NP problems etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, this <em>test</em> helps you to build plan for programming
related skills and gives understanding what you need to know to become an expert.</p>

<h3 id="teach-yourself-programming-in-ten-yearshttpnorvigcom21-dayshtml">4. <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years</a></h3>

<p>Article by Peter Norvig.
Great guy, I got to know from <a href="https://www.ai-class.com/">Artificial Intelligence</a> course.</p>

<p>His writing is critique of popular books, like “Learn Java in 21 Days”.
Peter explains that it is impossible to be a great
engineer in such short period, and to become an expert you need aproximately 10 years.</p>

<p>It reminds me a picture “How to become a C++ Developer in 21 Days”:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3FckcgF.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you totally disagree with his idea, just test yourself in previous article.</p>

<p>And logically continue. What behaviour differentiate senior engineer from “not senior” one?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mature engineers seek out constructive criticism of their designs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually you could find more useful rules there and list of
<strong>The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.</li>
    <li>You are not your code.</li>
    <li>No matter how much “karate” you know, someone else will always know more.</li>
    <li>Don’t rewrite code without consultation.</li>
    <li>Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.</li>
    <li>The only constant in the world is change. Be open to it and accept it with a smile.</li>
    <li>The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.</li>
    <li>Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat.</li>
    <li>Don’t be “the coder in the corner.”</li>
    <li>Critique code instead of people – be kind to the coder, not to the code.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Note, that article touch some psychological aspect of person. So I don’t
think it can be 100% applied to everyone, but still worth to read.</p>

<p>Jeff Atwood explais basic the idea of:</p>

  <p>The unexpected relationship between writing code and writing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To write good code, you must write good.</p>

<p>Article contains a reference to the book “The Elements of Style” with some quotes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words,
a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should
have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.
This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short,
or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.</p>

<p>Read this book. Perhaps it is boring, it contains some advices to improve you writing skills.</p>

then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.</p>

  <p>If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Permalink: <a href="http://projecteuler.net/problem=17">http://projecteuler.net/problem=17</a></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>To solve this problem we need some sort of mapping that defines association
between number and its string representation, e.g <code>123 = one hundred and twenty three</code>.</p>

<p>This can be done with maps in clojure in form <code>{:1 "one" :2 "two"}</code>.
But if pay more atention to this map, we see that key is a numeric value.
Exactly what plain arrays do.</p>

<p>Then we just define all mappings, obtain all arrays string elements, find their lengths and sum them.</p>

<p>One problem that providing mapping for each number between 1 and 1000 is a “bit” routine task, so we
need some formula to calculate representation instead of hardcoding it. We come to defining groups.</p>

<p>First group is just <em>first 20</em> numbers:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(def first20 ["one" "two" "three" "four" "five"
              "six" "seven" "eight" "nine" "ten"
              "eleven" "twelve" "thirteen" "fourteen" "fifteen"
              "sixteen" "seventeen" "eighteen" "nineteen"])
</code></p>

<p>Note: there is no “zero” as we don’t use it in spoken language.</p>

<p>Second group is numbers that divides 10:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(def decas ["" "ten" "twenty" "thirty" "forty" "fifty" "sixty" "seventy" "eighty" "ninety"])
</code></p>

<p>Note: empty first element here is used to reduce additional check. Its length is 0, that has no effect at all.</p>

<p>And the last ones are three used values:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(def h "hundred")
(def t "thousand")
(def a "and")
</code></p>

<p>The basic function will calculate the length string representation of some number.
Let’s call it <code>word-length</code>.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defn word-length [n]
  (cond (= n 1000) (+ (count t) (count (nth first20 1)))
        (&lt; n 100)
        (let [q (quot n 10) m (mod n 10)
              d (count (nth decas q))]
          (if (zero? m) d
              (if (&lt; q 2) (count (nth first20 (dec (+ m (* 10 q)))))
                  (+ d (count (nth first20 (dec m)))))))
        (&lt; n 1000)
        (let [q (quot n 100) m (mod n 100)]
          (if (zero? m) (+ (word-length q) (count h))
              (+ (count a) (count h) (word-length q) (word-length m))))))
</code></p>

<p>Little explanation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If number is <code>1000</code> then the length of string “one” + “thousand”, 11.</li>
  <li>If number is lower than <code>100</code> then extract its decade part. If there is no
reminder for division by 10, the length is length of that decade part.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, if number in <code>first20</code>, length taken from array <code>first20</code>.</li>
  <li>Otherwise the length is decade part plus remainder.</li>
  <li>If number is lower than <code>1000</code> then extract hundred part. If there is no
reminder for division by 100, the length is “hundred” plus number of hundreds.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the length is “hundred” plus number of hundreds, plus the word “and” and
recursively calculate the length of remainder, which is lower than <code>100</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Awful word-presentation of algorithm, because of… Reading code is much simpler, I know.</p>

<p>And the last part just sum up all word-lengths:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(reduce + (map word-length (range 1 1001)))
</code></p>

<p>Check the code <a href="https://github.com/mishadoff/project-euler/blob/master/src/project_euler/problem017.clj">here</a>.</p>

<p>P.S. In fact algorithm is very simple, but needs some time to understand few branches.
By the way, the problem is little boring.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Conway’s Game of Life in a tweet.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Recently, my friend pointed out me an article <a href="http://trelford.com/blog/post/140.aspx">Life in a tweet</a>
where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> was implemented in one tweet
(<em>less than 140 characters</em>) in Ruby and F#. I took this challenge.</p>

<h3 id="tweet">Tweet</h3>

<p>Here is the final version in <code>137</code> characters of Clojure:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(fn[g r](reduce(fn[i j](update-in i j(fn[v](get[v 1]
(-(apply +(map #(get-in g% 0)(for[a[-1 0 1]b[-1 0 1]]
(map + j[a b]))))v 2)0))))g r))
</code></p>

<h3 id="sugared-version">“Sugared” version</h3>

<p>Translate tweet to more readable code:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defn step-sugar [grid range]
  (let [count-neighbours ;; determine number of neighbours
        (fn[[i j]]
          (reduce + (map #(get-in grid % 0)
                         (for[a [-1 0 1] b [-1 0 1]]
                           [(+ i a) (+ j b)]))))
        new-value  ;; calculate new value for cell
        (fn [v [i j]]
          (let [c (- (count-neighbours [i j]) v)]
            (cond (= 3 c) 1
                  (= 2 c) v
                  :else 0)))
        evolve-cell ;; update cell in a grid
        (fn[g i] (update-in g i #(new-value % i)))]
    (reduce evolve-cell grid range)))
</code></p>

<p>Actually, this version is cheating,
due to passing one extra-parameter <code>range</code> that contains all indices
need to be updated in form <code>[[0 1] [1 1]]...</code></p>

<p>On the other side it gives us two features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Works for rectangular grid</strong>. Although, initial
implementation assumes the world is square.</li>
  <li><strong>Specific part of world can be updated</strong>. It gives possibility
to update specific area in the world, for example <em>west organisms evolve faster</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To use this function you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>World</li>
</ul>

<p><code>clojure
(def grid [[0 0 0]
           [1 1 1]
           [0 0 0]])
</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Evolution</li>
</ul>

<p><code>clojure
(defn evolution [g]
  (let [p (count g) q (count (get g 0))
        range (for [i (range p) j (range q)][i j])]
    (iterate #(step-sugar % range) g)))
</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Visualization</li>
</ul>

<p><code>clojure
(defn print-grid [g]
  (doseq [s (map #(apply str (replace {0 "." 1 "⚫"} %)) g)]
    (println s)))
</code></p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>To make sure results are correct use the following
<code>run</code> function and compare results to some common
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns">examples</a>.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defn run [grid]
  (doseq [g (evolution grid)]
    (print-grid g)
    (Thread/sleep 1000)))
</code></p>

<p>Pattern examples:</p>

<p>``` clojure
(def block [[0 0 0 0]
            [0 1 1 0]
            [0 1 1 0]
            [0 0 0 0]])</p>

<p>(def glider [[0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
             [1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0]
             [0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0]
             [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
             [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
             [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]])

<p>Are you kidding me?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find 1000th <em>power of two</em></li>
  <li>Sum its digits</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="/blog/clojure-euler-problem-008/">Clojure Euler: Problem 008</a> we
learned how to sum digits in the number. Just gentle reminder:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defn sum-of-digits [n]
  (reduce + (map #(- (int %) 48) (seq (str n)))))
</code></p>

<p>Now, let’s create sequence of powers of two:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(defn powers-of-2 []
  (iterate (partial * 2) 1))
</code></p>

<p>Unfortunately, this sequence throws <code>integer overflow</code> on the <code>64th</code> element.
We can fix that using <em>long arithmetics</em>, which known as <code>BigInteger</code> in Java.
Change <code>1</code> to <code>1N</code>.</p>

<p><code>clojure
(iterate (partial * 2) 1N)
</code></p>

<p>Another way is to use <strong>automatic promotion</strong> operator (<code>+'</code>, <code>*'</code>).
If result of some operation is not suitable for some type,
instead of invalid computation and runtime exception, clojure automatically promotes
the type to suitable one (<em>for example</em> <code>Long.MAX_VALUE +' 1</code> <em>works fine and produces
 correct result with type of</em> <code>BigInteger</code>):</p>

<p><code>clojure
(iterate (partial *' 2) 1)
</code></p>

<p>Choose <code>powers-of-2</code> that you prefer and final result will look like this:</p>

<p><code>clojure
(sum-of-digits (last (take 1001 (powers-of-2))))
</code></p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Automatic promotion is a beatiful thing. But be aware about losing in
speed of calculations. Also, no way back. If promotion happened, <em>depromotion</em> won’t.</p>
