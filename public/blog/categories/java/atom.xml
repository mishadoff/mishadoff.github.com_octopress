    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that all java classes start with the same 4 bytes. In hex it's <code>CAFEBABE</code>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>To make sure, create simple java file, call it <code>Hello.java</code>:</p>

<p>``` java
public class Hello {</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hell, O'World!");
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Compile it by <code>javac Hello.java</code>, and open <code>Hello.class</code> with hex-editor (<code>M-x hexl-mode</code> for emacs)</p>

<p>James Gosling <a href="http://radio-weblogs.com/0100490/2003/01/28.html">explained</a> this:</p>

<blockquote><p>We used to go to lunch at a place called St Michael's Alley.
According to local legend, in the deep dark past, the Grateful Dead used to perform there before they made it big.
It was a pretty funky place that was definitely a Grateful Dead Kinda Place.
When Jerry died, they even put up a little Buddhist-esque shrine.
When we used to go there, we referred to the place as Cafe Dead.
Somewhere along the line it was noticed that this was a HEX number.
I was re-vamping some file format code and needed a couple of magic numbers: one for the persistent object file, and one for classes.
I used CAFEDEAD for the object file format, and in grepping for 4 character hex words that fit after "CAFE" (it seemed to be a good theme)
I hit on BABE and decided to use it. At that time, it didn't seem terribly important or destined to go anywhere but the trash-can of history.
So CAFEBABE became the class file format, and CAFEDEAD was the persistent object format. But the persistent object facility went away,
and along with it went the use of CAFEDEAD - it was eventually replaced by RMI.</p></blockquote>

<p><code>0xCAFEBABE</code> is <code>3405691582</code> in decimal.
If we sum all digits we get <code>43</code>. One more than <code>42</code> - <em>Ultimate Answer to the Life, the Universe, and Everything</em>.
By the way, <code>43</code> is a prime number. You see, magic everywhere. Even in the last sentence.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>What do you think the output for lines 3 and 5 will be?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Definitely not <code>true, true</code> if the question was asked. Think for two minutes.</p>

<p>Ok. In most cases it will be <code>true, false</code> because you have internet connection (<em>How else you can read this?</em>).
Turn off your network cable or wi-fi, and you'll get <code>true, true</code>.</p>

<p>The reason is in implementation of <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code> methods for <code>URL</code> class.</p>

<p>Let's see how hashCode calculated:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">synchronized</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">hashCode</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="n">pre</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>  <span class="n">hashCode</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">handler</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">hashCode</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">hashCode</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>We can see hashCode is an instance variable that calculates once. Makes sense, <code>URL</code> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">immutable</a>.
What is handler? It's an instance of one of <code>URLStreamHandler</code> subclasses, depends on protocol type (file, http, ftp), that have helper hashCode implementation.
Just look at <code>URL.hashCode()</code> javadoc:</p>

<blockquote><p>The hash code is based upon all the URL components relevant for URL comparison. As such, this operation is a blocking operation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stop! <strong>BLOCKING OPERATION?!</strong></p>

<p><em>- Sorry, I couldn't check email yesterday due to hashCode calculation.</em></p>

<p>or even better</p>

<p><em>- No, mom, I can't watch porn, It's hashCode, you know.</em></p>

<p>Ok, let it be blocking. Another exciting part, that handler <strong>resolves host IP address</strong> for hashCode calculation.
Tries to resolve, to be honest. If it can not do this, it calculates hashCode based on host, which is <em>google.com</em> for our example.
Shit happens when IP is dynamic, or host have request balancer that also changes host IP.
In that case we got different hashCodes for one host name, and will have two (or even more) instances in HashSet. Not good at all.
By the way, hashCode and equals performance is terrible because of <code>URLStreamHandler</code> opens <code>URLConnection</code>. But it's another topic.</p>

<h3>How to avoid this?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>java.net.URI</code> instead of <code>java.net.URL</code>. It's not the best choice though, but have deterministic hashCode implementation.</li>
<li>Do not use <code>java.net.URL</code> in collections. Good option to maintain collection of String objects (that represent host name) and get URL when needed.</li>
<li>Disable your network adapter during hashCode calculation. (<em>It's a joke, but it helps</em>)</li>
<li>Use your own subclass of URLStreamHandler with proper implementation of hashCode.</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, I'm pretty sure <code>java.net.URL</code> class has lot of useful applications. But not that way.</p>
