    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Java is a safe programming language and prevents programmer
from doing memory corruption mistakes. But, there is a way to
do such <em>mistakes</em> intentionally, using <code>Unsafe</code> class.</p>

<p>This article is quick overview of <code>sun.misc.Unsafe</code> <em>public</em> API and few
interesting cases of its usage.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h3 id="unsafe-instantiation">Unsafe instantiation</h3>

<p>Before usage, we need to create instance of <code>Unsafe</code> object.
There is no simple way to do it like <code>Unsafe unsafe = new Unsafe()</code>,
because <code>Unsafe</code> class has private constructor and <code>getUnsafe()</code> method
available only from trusted code.</p>

<p>We can make our code “trusted”.</p>

<p><code>Unsafe</code> class contains its instance called <code>theUnsafe</code>, which marked as <code>private</code>.
We can steal that variable via java reflection.</p>

<p><code>java
Field f = Unsafe.class.getDeclaredField("theUnsafe");
f.setAccessible(true);
Unsafe unsafe = (Unsafe) f.get(null);
</code></p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Ignore your IDE. For example, eclipse show error “Access restriction…”
but if you run code, all works just fine. If the error is annoying, ignore errors on
<code>Unsafe</code> usage in:</p>

<pre><code>Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Compiler -&gt; Errors/Warnings -&gt;
Deprecated and restricted API -&gt; Forbidden reference -&gt; Warning
</code></pre>

<h3 id="unsafe-api">Unsafe API</h3>

<p>Class <a href="http://www.docjar.com/docs/api/sun/misc/Unsafe.html">sun.misc.Unsafe</a>
consists of <code>105</code> methods. There are, actually,
few groups of important methods for manipulating with various entities.
Here is some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Info</strong>. Just returns some low-level memory information.
    <ul>
      <li><code>addressSize</code></li>
      <li><code>pageSize</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Objects</strong>. Provides methods for object and its fields manipulation.
    <ul>
      <li><code>allocateInstance</code></li>
      <li><code>objectFieldOffset</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Classes</strong>. Provides methods for classes and static fields manipulation.
    <ul>
      <li><code>staticFieldOffset</code></li>
      <li><code>defineClass</code></li>
      <li><code>defineAnonymousClass</code></li>
      <li><code>ensureClassInitialized</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Arrays</strong>. Arrays manipulation.
    <ul>
      <li><code>arrayBaseOffset</code></li>
      <li><code>arrayIndexScale</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Synchronization</strong>. Low level primitives for synchronization.
    <ul>
      <li><code>monitorEnter</code></li>
      <li><code>tryMonitorEnter</code></li>
      <li><code>monitorExit</code></li>
      <li><code>compareAndSwapInt</code></li>
      <li><code>putOrderedInt</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Memory</strong>. Direct memory access methods.
    <ul>
      <li><code>allocateMemory</code></li>
      <li><code>copyMemory</code></li>
      <li><code>freeMemory</code></li>
      <li><code>getAddress</code></li>
      <li><code>getInt</code></li>
      <li><code>putInt</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interesting-use-cases">Interesting use cases</h3>

<h4 id="avoid-initialization">Avoid initialization</h4>

<p><code>allocateInstance</code> method can be <em>useful</em> when you need to skip object initialization phase
or bypass security checks in constructor. Consider following class:</p>

<p>``` java
class A {
    private long a; // not initialized value</p>

<pre><code>public A() {
    this.a = 1; // initialization
}

public long a() { return this.a; } } ```
</code></pre>

<p>Instantiating it using constructor, reflection and unsafe gives
different results.</p>

<p>``` java
A o1 = new A(); // constructor
o1.a(); // prints 1</p>

<p>A o2 = A.class.newInstance(); // reflection
o2.a(); // prints 1</p>

<p>A o3 = (A) unsafe.allocateInstance(A.class); // unsafe
o3.a(); // prints 0
```</p>

<h4 id="sizeof"><strong>sizeOf</strong></h4>

<p>Using <code>objectFieldOffset</code> method we can implement C-style <code>sizeof</code> function.
This implementation returns <em>shallow</em> size of object:</p>

<p>``` java
public static long sizeOf(Object o) {
    Unsafe u = getUnsafe();
    HashSet<field> fields = new HashSet<field>();
    Class c = o.getClass();
    while (c != Object.class) {
        for (Field f : c.getDeclaredFields()) {
            if ((f.getModifiers() &amp; Modifier.STATIC) == 0) {
                fields.add(f);
            }
        }
        c = c.getSuperclass();
    }</field></field></p>

<pre><code>// get offset
long maxSize = 0;
for (Field f : fields) {
    long offset = u.objectFieldOffset(f);
    if (offset &gt; maxSize) {
        maxSize = offset;
    }
}

return ((maxSize/8) + 1) * 8;   // padding } ```
</code></pre>

<p>Algorithm is the following: go through all <em>non-static</em> fields including all
superclases, get offset for each field, find maximum and add padding.
Probably, I missed something, but idea is clear.</p>

<p>In fact, for good and accurate <code>sizeof</code> function better to use
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html">java.lang.instrument</a> package</p>

<h4 id="big-arrays"><strong>Big Arrays</strong></h4>

<p>As you know <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> constant is a max size of java array.
Using direct memory allocation we can create arrays with size limited by only heap size.</p>

<p>Here is <code>SuperArray</code> implementation:</p>

<p>``` java
class SuperArray {
    private final static int BYTE = 1;</p>

<pre><code>private long size;
private long address;

public SuperArray(long size) {
    this.size = size;
    address = getUnsafe().allocateMemory(size * BYTE);
}

public void set(long i, byte value) {
    getUnsafe().putByte(address + i * BYTE, value);
}

public int get(long idx) {
    return getUnsafe().getByte(address + idx * BYTE);
}

public long size() {
    return size;
} } ```
</code></pre>

<p>And sample usage:</p>

<p><code>java
long SUPER_SIZE = (long)Integer.MAX_VALUE * 2;
SuperArray array = new SuperArray(SUPER_SIZE);
System.out.println("Array size:" + array.size()); // 4294967294
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
    array.set((long)Integer.MAX_VALUE + i, (byte)3);
    sum += array.get((long)Integer.MAX_VALUE + i);
}
System.out.println("Sum of 100 elements:" + sum);  // 300
</code></p>

<h4 id="memory-corruption">Memory corruption</h4>

<p>This one is usual for every C programmer.
By the way, its common technique for security bypass.</p>

<p>Consider some easy class that check acces rules:</p>

<p>``` java
class Guard {
    private int ACCESS_ALLOWED = 1;</p>

<pre><code>public boolean giveAccess() {
    return 42 == ACCESS_ALLOWED;
} } ```
</code></pre>

<p>The client code is <em>very secure</em> and calls
<code>giveAccess()</code> to check access rules. Unfortunately, for clients,
it always returns <code>false</code>. Only privileged users <em>somehow</em> can change
value of <code>ACCESS_ALLOWED</code> constant and get access.</p>

<p>In fact, it’s not true. Here is the code demostrates it:</p>

<p>``` java
Guard guard = new Guard();
guard.giveAccess();   // false, no access</p>

<p>// bypass
Unsafe unsafe = getUnsafe();
Field f = guard.getClass().getDeclaredField(“ACCESS_ALLOWED”);
unsafe.putInt(guard, unsafe.objectFieldOffset(f), 42); // memory corruption</p>

<p>guard.giveAccess(); // true, access granted
```</p>

<p>Now all clients will get unlimited access.</p>

<h4 id="concurrency">Concurrency</h4>

<p><code>compareAndSwap</code> methods are atomic and can be used to implement
high-performance lock-free data structures.</p>

<p>For example, consider the problem to increment value in the shared object
using lot of threads.</p>

<p>First we define simple interface <code>Counter</code>:</p>

<p><code>java
interface Counter {
    void increment();
    long getCounter();
}
</code></p>

<p>Then we define worker thread <code>CounterClient</code>, that uses <code>Counter</code>:</p>

<p>``` java
class CounterClient implements Runnable {
    private Counter c;
    private int num;</p>

<pre><code>public CounterClient(Counter c, int num) {
    this.c = c;
    this.num = num;
}

@Override
public void run() {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; num; i++) {
        c.increment();
    }
} } ```
</code></pre>

<p>And this is testing code:</p>

<p><code>java
int NUM_OF_THREADS = 1000;
int NUM_OF_INCREMENTS = 100000;
ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NUM_OF_THREADS);
Counter counter = ... // creating instance of specific counter
long before = System.currentTimeMillis();
for (int i = 0; i &lt; NUM_OF_THREADS; i++) {
    service.submit(new CounterClient(counter, NUM_OF_INCREMENTS));
}
service.shutdown();
service.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
long after = System.currentTimeMillis();
System.out.println("Counter result: " + c.getCounter());
System.out.println("Time passed in ms:" + (after - before));
</code></p>

<p>First implementation is not-synchronized counter:</p>

<p>``` java
class StupidCounter implements Counter {
    private long counter = 0;</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void increment() {
    counter++;
}

@Override
public long getCounter() {
    return counter;
} } ```
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<p><code>
Counter result: 99542945
Time passed in ms: 679
</code></p>

<p>Working fast, but no threads management at all, so result is inaccurate.
Second attempt, add easiest java-way synchronization:</p>

<p>``` java
class SyncCounter implements Counter {
    private long counter = 0;</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public synchronized void increment() {
    counter++;
}

@Override
public long getCounter() {
    return counter;
} } ```
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<p><code>
Counter result: 100000000
Time passed in ms: 10136
</code></p>

<p>Radical synchronization always work. But timings is awful.
Let’s try <code>ReentrantReadWriteLock</code>:</p>

<p>``` java
class LockCounter implements Counter {
    private long counter = 0;
    private WriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock().writeLock();</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void increment() {
    lock.lock();
    counter++;
    lock.unlock();
}

@Override
public long getCounter() {
    return counter;
} } ```
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<p><code>
Counter result: 100000000
Time passed in ms: 8065
</code></p>

<p>Still correct, and timings are better. What about atomics?</p>

<p>``` java
class AtomicCounter implements Counter {
    AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong(0);</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void increment() {
    counter.incrementAndGet();
}

@Override
public long getCounter() {
    return counter.get();
} } ```
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<p><code>
Counter result: 100000000
Time passed in ms: 6552
</code></p>

<p><code>AtomicCounter</code> is even better. Finally, try <code>Unsafe</code>
primitive <code>compareAndSwapLong</code> to see if it is really privilegy to use it.</p>

<p>``` java
class CASCounter implements Counter {
    private long counter = 0;
    private Unsafe unsafe;
    private long offset;</p>

<pre><code>public CASCounter() throws Exception {
    unsafe = getUnsafe();
    offset = unsafe.objectFieldOffset(CASCounter.class.getDeclaredField("counter"));
}

@Override
public void increment() {
    long before = counter;
    while (!unsafe.compareAndSwapLong(this, offset, before, before + 1)) {
        before = counter;
    }
}

@Override
public long getCounter() {
    return counter;
} ```
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<p><code>
Counter result: 100000000
Time passed in ms: 6454
</code></p>

<p>Hmm, seems equal to atomics. Maybe atomics use <code>Unsafe</code>? (<em>YES</em>)</p>

<p>In fact this example is easy enough, but it shows real power of <code>Unsafe</code>.</p>

<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>

<p>Documentation for <code>park</code> method from <code>Unsafe</code> class contains
longest English sentence I’ve ever seen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Block current thread, returning when a balancing
unpark occurs, or a balancing unpark has
already occurred, or the thread is interrupted, or, if not
absolute and time is not zero, the given time nanoseconds have
elapsed, or if absolute, the given deadline in milliseconds
since Epoch has passed, or spuriously (i.e., returning for no
“reason”). Note: This operation is in the Unsafe class only
because unpark is, so it would be strange to place it
elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Although, <code>Unsafe</code> has a bunch of useful applications, never use it.</p>

with some code examples.</p>

<p><em>Do not try to reproduce any of these!</em></p>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every last bug is the last but one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Bugs</strong> are bad. Some of them cause uncomfortable work, more actions
than expected, inconsistency, layout issues, etc.
Some of them “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undocumented_feature">not a bug</a>” at all.</p>

<p><strong>Bad bugs</strong> much worse. They cause data corruption, invalid data representation,
unavailability to perform action, losing integrity and so on.</p>

<p>There are <strong>critical bugs</strong> with painful consequences. They can damage the health, nature, people
break buildings, technics. Theoretically, they
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/coldwar/shatter021099b.htm">can lead to World War III</a>.
Hope, it’s just theoretically.</p>

<p>If you are software engineer, you definitely will commit the bugs. No panacea.
But if we aware about common mistakes, then less likely we make that mistakes.</p>

<p>This article is review of famous most critical software bugs
including brief history, consequences, root causes, possible solutions, code examples and some advices.</p>

<h3 id="mariner-1httpenwikipediaorgwikimariner1-1962"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_1">Mariner 1</a> (1962)</h3>

<p><strong>History:</strong>
In 1962, spacecraft <em>Mariner 1</em> was guided by computer program with error causes
racket do not follow its expected trajectory. To prevent tragic consequences, racket
was destoyed immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Money, $18 million.</p>

<p><strong>Reason:</strong>
There are tons of versions about what type of error it was, but official version
is <em>missing hyphen</em> (‘-‘) in program. Maybe it’s just a myth for publicity,
but, anyway, if the reason of bug is incorrect handwritten formula transcription
from paper to computer, it’s sad.</p>

<p>Probably, the root cause of that is writer and computer operator were different people.
It’s common case for that times. <em>Programming</em> was synonym to the <em>scientific calculations</em> not
an enterprise, as nowadays. That’s why scientist, programmer, and operator could be
different people.</p>

<p>Related story, it’s why zero symbol has a period or diagonal line inside - to prevent
confusing with “big O” for “typer” person. Just compare <code>0</code> and <code>O</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong>
It’s hardly can be a problem today (as it was 50 years ago), but if you write for somebody on the paper, write it accurate.
If you type into computer from someone’s paper sheet, check, re-check and double re-check
what you typing. Ask if you have concerns. Especially, if it is the program for spaceship.</p>

<p>In very <em>far-fetched</em> example missing minus sign can result into invalid computation:</p>

<p>``` java
double getDiscountPercent() {
    return 0.25; // instead of return -0.25;
}</p>

<p>double calculatePrice(double initial) {
    return initial * (1.0 + getDiscountPercent());
}
```</p>

<p>That way instead of paying $75, you pay $125.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Always check your manual rewriting actions.</p>

<h3 id="siberian-pipeline-sabotagehttpenwikipediaorgwikisiberianpipelinesabotage-1982"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_pipeline_sabotage">Siberian pipeline sabotage</a> (1982)</h3>

<p><strong>History:</strong> Cold war. Soviet Union steal technology for managing gas pipelines from Canada. This
technology intentionally contained the bug (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_bomb">Logic Bomb</a>), developed by CIA
for sabotage purposes. Bomb triggered.</p>

<p><strong>Consequences:</strong> The greatest non-nuclear explosion in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Reason:</strong> Every microship from stolen technology would
work fine just for 10 million cycles, after that switches to another mode.</p>

<p>They <em>used someone’s code</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You shall not steal</p>

  <p>– <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments">Ten Commandments</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, if someone’s technology used for critical areas, like gas
transportation, it must be reviewed and tested. 100 times.</p>

<p>Story can be translated as:</p>

<p>I found memory card on the city dump.
Card contained one shell script <code>please-execute-me.sh</code>.
I <em>executed</em> it. System crashed. Who’s guilty? Just me.</p>

<p>Use software from trusted sources.</p>

<p>In modern software world, we often use someone’s libraries, frameworks,
APIs to build our own applications. We <em>expect</em> that code is <em>reviewed</em> and <em>tested</em>.
If not, we can help to do it. How we can be sure these libs without logic bombs?</p>

<p>Trust or review the sources. That’s why I love open source software.</p>

<p>Logic bomb detection is not that hard. Just find the code that causes error
and see the reason of that error. Again, code review helps <em>to prevent</em> the
logic bomb instead of <em>fixing it</em>. Build application to production only from
version control system (<em>which is controlled, right?</em>)</p>

<p>Just for educational purposes: simple example of time-triggered logic bomb</p>

<p>``` java
public class LogicBombRunner {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
                Thread thread = new Thread(new LogicBomb());
                thread.start();
        }
}</p>

<p>class LogicBomb implements Runnable {</p>

<pre><code>    private long toStop;
    private final long TIME_TO_TRIGGER = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 100;

    public LogicBomb() {
            toStop = System.currentTimeMillis() + TIME_TO_TRIGGER;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
            while (true) {
                    if (System.currentTimeMillis() &lt; toStop) {
                            System.out.println("System works fine.");
                            try {
                                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                                    e.printStackTrace();
                            }
                    } else {
                            System.out.println("Logic bomb triggered.");
                            throw new RuntimeException();
                    }
            }
    } }
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Yes. It throws <code>RuntimeException</code> after approximately 100 days from <code>LogicBomb</code> object creation.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Do not steal. Trust to very limited circle of people.</p>

<h3 id="therac-25httpenwikipediaorgwikitherac-25-1985---1987"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25">Therac-25</a> (1985 - 1987)</h3>

<p><strong>History:</strong> Therac-25 was a medical device for radiation therapy.
It could deliver either beta-particles or X-rays. Unfortunately,
operating system for controling the device was written with error,
that causes sad results.</p>

<p><strong>Consequences:</strong> At least 2 patients died, 4 patients were given overdose,
approximately 100 times intended dose.</p>

<p><strong>Reason:</strong> Investigation concluded the common reason was a
<em>bad software design</em>, <em>development practices</em> and a <em>set of bugs</em>
instead of some particular critical bug.</p>

<p>These bad practices and bugs include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No code review</li>
  <li>Poor exception handling</li>
  <li>No integration testing until device was assembled in the hospital</li>
  <li>Poor hardware design</li>
  <li><em>Bad code</em> reuse</li>
  <li>Concurrency issues</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Code review its a must. Even if you working
alone in the team, show sources to some your friend (programmer).
Two pair of eyes can spot the mistake two times more.</p>

<p><em>Poor exception handling</em>. If failure occurs, no one knows about that failure.
Never handle exception like that:</p>

<p>``` java
catch (SomeException e) {</p>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>In 99% there are must be a proper handling. If you don’t know how
to handle, rethrow it, possible with wrapping:</p>

<p><code>java
catch (SomeException e) {
   throw new SpecificException(e);
}
</code></p>

<p>Much better to throw responsibility for handling one level up
in method signature:</p>

<p><code>java
void method() throws SomeException
</code></p>

<p>If your real intention to left catch block empty, say this:</p>

<p><code>java
catch (SomeExcpetion e) {
  // swallowing this exception is intended
}
</code></p>

<p><em>Bad code reuse</em>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse">Code reuse</a> is a good thing.
Except the case when you reuse something with errors.</p>

<p>For example, I have following method for testing if number is even in some of my
previous projects (<em>yes, look at your code that was written few years ago</em>):</p>

<p><code>java
static boolean isEven(int num) {
    return num % 2 != 1;
}
</code></p>

<p>This method returns incorrect result <code>true</code> for all negative odd numbers. Just because
<code>%</code> operator returns <code>-1</code> except <code>1</code> for negative numbers. Better do <em>NOT</em> reuse such method.
Just write new. And replace old method immediately.</p>

<p><code>java
static boolean isEven(int num) {
    return num % 2 == 0;
}
</code></p>

<p><em>Concurrency</em>. Software world hardest issues are concurrency issues.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have a problem and decide to use threads.
Two now problems have you.</p>

  <p>– Some guy from internet
<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have a problem and decide to use locks.
Now you have</p>

  <p>– Some another guy from internet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you know that some object will be shared between threads, one solution to
add <code>synchronized</code> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_%28synchronization%29">Monitor object</a>)
to each read/write state method. It will slow
your work with that object but prevent a lot of unexpected errors.</p>

<p>Although, there are much flexible synchronization mechanisms in java that
plain old <code>synchronized</code> as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_%28programming%29">semaphores</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion">mutexes</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_write_lock_pattern">read-write locks</a>.</p>

<p>I reccomend to use java package <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html">java.util.concurrent</a>.
It consists of a lot of concurrency techniques, like <code>Synchronizers</code>, <code>Executors</code>,
<code>Atomics</code>, <code>Concurrent Collections</code>, <code>Futures</code>, <code>Callbacks</code> etc.</p>

<p><strong>As a bonus:</strong> Good books about concurrency in Java:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127932.Java_Concurrency_in_Practice">Java Concurrency in Practice</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/629608.Concurrent_Programming_in_Java">Concurrent Programming in Java</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Always handle exceptions. Pay more attention to concurrency issues.</p>

<h3 id="patriot-missilehttpenwikipediaorgwikimim-104patriot-1991"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot">Patriot Missile</a> (1991)</h3>

<p><strong>History:</strong> In 1991, American battery fired Patriot Missile to intercept Iraq missile.
Interception failed because of system bug in time step calculation.
Iraq missile destroyed an American Army barracks.</p>

<p><strong>Consequences:</strong> 28 soldiers died, 100 injured.</p>

<p><strong>Reason:</strong> Floating point rounding error. System’s internal clock was calculating
time by 0.1 seconds step (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, …). As <code>0.1 = 1/10</code> have infinite binary representation
<code>0.0001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011001100..</code>
and for this calculation 24-bit register was used,
register hold just <code>0.00011001100110011001100</code> introducing truncating error
<code>0.00000000000000000000000110011</code> what is approximately <code>0.0000001</code> in decimal.</p>

<p>Small enough, huh?</p>

<p>Not really, Multiplying this number for 100 hours gives:</p>

<pre><code>0.0000001 * 100 * 60 * 60 * 10 = 0.36 sec
</code></pre>

<p>During that time Iraq missile travels a half kilometer, and was out of tracking radius
for Patriot Missile. Bad things happen.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Floats are very error-prone if we don’t handle them correctly.</p>

<p>Predict the output of the following code:</p>

<p><code>java
for (double d = 0.0; d != 1.0; d = d + 0.1) {
    System.out.println("Iteration");
}
</code></p>

<p>Infinite loop. The same problem as described above.</p>

<p>One solution is to use float that have exact binary representation.
<code>0.125</code>, <code>0.25</code>, <code>0.5</code> for example.
But this greatly reduces the space of allowed values and give less flexibility.</p>

<p>Another solution to use big decimal or ratio types.
Java, as example, have out-of-the-box <code>BigDecimal</code> class. Loop above rewritten with
that class works as expected:</p>

<p>``` java
BigDecimal init = new BigDecimal(“0.0”);
BigDecimal bound = new BigDecimal(“1.0”);
BigDecimal step = new BigDecimal(“0.1”)</p>

<p>for (BigDecimal d = init; !d.equals(bound); d = d.add(step)) {
        System.out.println(d);
}
```</p>

<p>One disadvantage it has slower execution than with floats. Consider trade-off
between time and accuracy. If human lives on the stake, it’s not relevant choice.</p>

<p><code>Ratio</code> class can be defined without any problems and used similar way.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> If you need very accurate calculations use big decimals or ratios.</p>

<h3 id="mars-climate-orbiterhttpenwikipediaorgwikimarsclimateorbiter-1998"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter">Mars Climate Orbiter</a> (1998)</h3>

<p><strong>History:</strong> Again about space. In 1998, communication with Mars Climate Orbiter
was lost, because of changed trajectory. Space probe was crashed near Mars.</p>

<p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Money, $327 million</p>

<p><strong>Reason:</strong> Navigation system design was developed by another team.
To represent Force they used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound-force">pound-force</a>
from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units">Imperial units</a>
instead of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_%28unit%29">Newton</a>
from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system">metric system</a>.</p>

<pre><code>1 Newton = 0.22 pound-force
</code></pre>

<p>Without provided conversion between them system failed.</p>

<p>Issue resemble to using dates in different timezones, but much more critical.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> First of all, at least one science-aware person must perform code review.
At least for code blocks with formulas and calculations. If there are comments about using pound-force,
the problem easy spotted. Second of all, received code must be tested on model
instead of physical machine. This is also, likely, detects the issue.
Developer who wrote that less guilty, but still guilty.</p>

<p>There are different approaches to implement this in java:</p>

<p>very bad approach, we don’t know what units are used:</p>

<p><code>java
new Force(1.533);
</code></p>

<p>better (still bad) approach to indicate with comment:</p>

<p><code>java
// force in Newtons!
new Force(1.533);
</code></p>

<p>better (still bad) approach to indicate different constructors for different units:</p>

<p><code>java
new ForceInNewtons(1.533);
</code></p>

<p>I prefer approach where you specifies a <em>value</em> and <em>unit</em> in the constructor, and
they converted to something common unit (metric) convenient for use in internal representation:</p>

<p>``` java
enum ForceUnit {
  NEWTON,
  POUND_FORCE
}</p>

<p>new Force(1.533, ForceUnit.NEWTON);
```</p>

<p>A bit more code, but it is understandable and easy to use for different unit systems.
Unit conversion method can be defined either at the <code>enum ForceUnit</code> or <code>class Force</code> level.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Always explicitly indicate what units used in your code.</p>

<p><em>To be continued.</em></p>

    <id>http://mishadoff.github.com/blog/eclipse-speedup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you been in situation where most of the time in eclipse you were waiting for
some operation to be finished?</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/34/Eclipse-logo.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you here, probably, the answer is yes. You are bored with that slow functionality and want
to increase eclipse performance to make your development work more comfortable. It is the right thing to do.</p>

<p><em>Warning:</em> Most frequent advice I heard <em>to add more RAM</em>. Probably, you can buy better workstation with better CPU.
Add SSD to make filesystem operations faster. We assume you can’t afford all that. All you can is setup your
eclipse instance. All preferences based on <code>Eclipse SDK Version: 4.3.0 Build id: I20121031-2000</code> for ubuntu, but
almost everything is identical in other versions for other platforms.</p>

<h3 id="eclipse-tweaks">Eclipse tweaks</h3>

<h4 id="plugins">Plugins</h4>

<p>First time I found the power of plugins I was excited. I installed them more and more until I couldn’t
work comfortable with eclipse. Probably, you have a lot of plugins, just <strong>disable</strong> on startup ones that not used.
It is not deleting, you always can enable it back.</p>

<pre><code>Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Startup and Shutdown
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kgavA.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>By the way, some plugins appeared due to your experimenting and not used anymore. <strong>Delete</strong> redundant plugins if they
not used at all.</p>

<pre><code>Help -&gt; About Eclipse SDK -&gt; Instalation Details -&gt; &lt;Select plugin&gt; -&gt; Uninstall
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7wRoR.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="eclipseini">eclipse.ini</h4>

<p>Following tweaks based on editing <code>eclipse.ini</code> file located in root folder
of your eclipse instalation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use specific JVM to run eclipse.</strong>
This allows do not take into account system properties which alters your JDK.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>
-vm
/path/to/your/java
</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use latest JDK to run eclipse.</strong>
Much better if you point your eclipse to the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">latest JDK</a>.
<em>Rumors</em> said it has better performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use Sun JDK to run eclipse.</strong>
The reason behind this has the same explanation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Configure VM arguments.</strong>
You can set your own values for virtual machine if you think
they are appropriate
(<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/vmoptions-jsp-140102.html#PerformanceTuning">Performance related options</a>)
I use following settings to increase heap size (objects) to <code>768Mb</code> and permgen (classes) to <code>256 Mb</code> on my <code>3Gb</code> RAM machine.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><code>
-vmargs
-Xms768m
-Xmx768m
-XX:PermSize=256m
-XX:MaxPermSize=256m
</code></p>

<p>You can also add <code>-Xverify:none</code> that skips validation of loaded clases to JVM. Due to fact it skips one
step of JVM loading you will get performance boost. But it’s very risky change.</p>

<p>You can also test your eclipse performance  with different Garbage collector strategies, server options,
experimental VM options like (some of these):</p>

<p><code>
-server
-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
-XX:+UseG1GC
-XX:+UseParallelGC
-XX:+UseFastAccessorMethods
-Xss2m
</code></p>

<p>Check all <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fmisc%2Fruntime-options.html">Eclipse runtime options</a>
for reference and choose ones that appropriate for you.</p>

<h4 id="disable-animations">Disable animations</h4>

<p>Animations it’s cool. But I always disable animations if it possible in all tools.
Also, classic theme is most usable for me.</p>

<pre><code>Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Uncheck 'Enable animations'
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mzLp7.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="disable-label-decorations">Disable label decorations</h4>

<p>Label decorations are small icons on project, file, class levels that helps
visually indicate some state of file. Like commited it to git or no.
They are provided by various plugins and rarely useful. Just left ones that you want.</p>

<pre><code>Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Label Decorations
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MKZp5.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="autocompletion">Autocompletion</h4>

<p>Sometimes on slow machines or when you have a lot of classes in your classpath autocompletion performance is terrible.
Small improvement you can get by reducing group of possible proposals. I left only <code>Java Proposals</code> and <code>Template Proposals</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Editor -&gt; Content Assist -&gt; Advanced
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Aa7MY.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="uncheck-validators">Uncheck validators</h4>

<p>If you are sure in your competence just suspend all validators. If problem appears, you always
can identify the reason, but you save your development time.</p>

<pre><code>Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Validation -&gt; Suspend All Validators
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/n1XQ2.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="close-unrelated-projects">Close unrelated projects</h4>

<p>If you working in context of few projects, better to have all unrelated projects closed. They won’t appear
in index. You can manually <code>Close unrelated projects</code> in workspace. But I recommend to use <code>Working Set</code>.
You can add any number of projects to one working set, and quickly switch between different working sets
in one workspace.</p>

<pre><code>Right Click on Project -&gt; Assign Working Sets..
</code></pre>

<h4 id="close-unused-tabs-in-editor">Close unused tabs in editor</h4>

<p>Big number of tabs in editor can greatly slow down your performance. Just limit them.</p>

<pre><code>Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Editors
</code></pre>

<p>Check <code>Close editors automatically</code> and set <code>Number of opened tabs</code> to <code>10</code>.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gjRd8.png" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="disable-spell-check">Disable spell check</h4>

<p>Are you developer or what? I don’t see any reason to have <code>spell check</code> enabled.</p>

<pre><code>Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Editors -&gt; Text Editors -&gt; Spelling -&gt; Uncheck 'Enable spell checking'
</code></pre>

<h4 id="disable-autobuild">Disable autobuild</h4>

<p>Probably, you aware about when you want to build your project and when not.</p>

<pre><code>Project -&gt; Uncheck 'Build Automatically'
Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Compiler -&gt; Building -&gt; Uncheck 'Scrub output folders when cleaning'
Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Compiler -&gt; Building -&gt; Uncheck 'Rebuild class files modified by others'
</code></pre>

<h4 id="hotkeys">Hotkeys</h4>

<p>It is human-related advice. Even if you working in super-fast IDE and spend 10 actions to perform
single operation, your development process won’t be fast. Configure most-often used actions
to hotkeys and learn them. You will get a positive feedback after a week of usage.</p>

<pre><code>Windows -&gt; Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Keys
</code></pre>

<p>To force myself learn all hotkeys I just disabled toolbar.</p>

<pre><code>Window -&gt; Hide Toolbar
</code></pre>

    <link href="http://mishadoff.github.com/blog/java-magic-part-3-finally/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-18T19:39:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://mishadoff.github.com/blog/java-magic-part-3-finally</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every experienced java programmer should know that <code>finally</code> block always executed. But is it true?</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It depends on our definition of program execution. But, generally speaking, <strong>yes</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="normal-program-execution">Normal program execution</h3>

<p><em>Aha, look at this</em>, someone might retort:</p>

<p><code>java
try {
  System.exit(1);
} finally {
  System.out.println("I'm here, man");
}
</code></p>

<p><em>You just said, finally block always executed?</em></p>

<p>Well. In that case no, because we speaking about normal flow of program execution.
This is <em>abnormal</em>.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/finally.html">official tutorial</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: If the JVM exits while the try or catch code is being executed, then the finally block may not execute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your counter question might be: <em>If second line of that code always exectued?</em></p>

<p><code>java
System.out.println("Line 1");
System.out.println("Line 2");
System.out.println("Line 3");
</code></p>

<p>Sure, because it’s linear flow. Nothing can break…<strong>BANG</strong>…<code>Electricity unavailable. Program stopped.</code></p>

<p>What about this? It’s also abnormal program execution, and we can’t guarantee anything for 100%.
In fact, this is the same as <code>System.exit(1)</code> or <code>reset</code> button on your computer or whatever.</p>

<p>That’s why, we are talking about <em>normal</em> program execution. Only <em>normal</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I said yes? I meant no!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="perpetuum-mobile">Perpetuum Mobile</h3>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<p><code>java
try {
  while (true) {
    System.out.println("I print here some useful information");
  }
} finally {
  System.out.println("Let me run");
}
</code></p>

<p>Will be the line <em>“Let me run”</em> printed? Maybe yes, if printing error to standard output appear. Almost always the answer is no.</p>

<p>In that case, there are no difference between simple statement and finally block. None of them will be executed, throw this example away.</p>

<h3 id="threads">Threads</h3>

<p>What about threads? We know that execution flow controlled by threads and they can be interrupted.</p>

<p>Assume that we have thread that perform some work, and other thread kills first one right before finally block. Finally wasn’t executed.</p>

<p>Assume that we have deadlock between two threads, right before finally line. The same thing.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/finally.html">same tutorial</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…if the thread executing the try or catch code is interrupted or killed, the finally block may not execute even though the application as a whole continues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, we can treat thread like a program, and make one effective rule:</p>

<p><strong>Rule 1</strong>. Finally executes always, except the case where controlling program or thread was aborted.</p>

<h3 id="finally-we-return">Finally we return</h3>

<p>Ok, now we know when finally is not executed. But do we know when finally is executed?</p>

<p>Consider the example:</p>

<p><code>java
int someFunc() {
  try {
    return 0;
  } finally {
    return 1;
  }
}
</code></p>

<p>The result is obviously <code>1</code>. Just because <code>finally</code> is always executed.</p>

<p>Consider, next example:</p>

<p><code>java
int someFunc() {
  try {
    throw new RuntimeException();
  } finally {
    return 1;
  }
}
</code></p>

<p>The result is <code>1</code> again. And it’s a problem. We just lose the exception.
Such issue known as <em>exception swallowing</em>. It is very dangerous, because client’s code expect either exception or some value, but it always get only value.</p>

<p>One more less imaginary example.</p>

<p><code>java
String deposit(int amount) throws DAOException {
  try {
    return dao.deposit(amount);
  } finally {
    return "OK";
  }
}
</code></p>

<p>The logic behind <code>finally</code> is to have some default value, and our <code>deposit</code> method throws the <code>DAOException</code> where client code is
responsible for its handling. Unfortunately, perhaps compiler forces you to handle this <code>DAOException</code> it never occurs. And string “OK” will be returned.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 2</strong>. Never use <code>return</code> from <code>finally</code> block.</p>

<h3 id="instead-of-conclusion">Instead of conclusion</h3>

<p>A lot of programmers are aware about this common mistake. But some are not.
Maybe these two simple rules give you a tiny light on coward <code>finally</code>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that all java classes start with the same 4 bytes. In hex it’s <code>CAFEBABE</code>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>To make sure, create simple java file, call it <code>Hello.java</code>:</p>

<p><code>java

<p><img src="/images/cafebabe.png" alt="" title="cafebabe" /></p>

<p>James Gosling <a href="http://radio-weblogs.com/0100490/2003/01/28.html">explained</a> this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We used to go to lunch at a place called St Michael’s Alley.
According to local legend, in the deep dark past, the Grateful Dead used to perform there before they made it big.
It was a pretty funky place that was definitely a Grateful Dead Kinda Place.
When Jerry died, they even put up a little Buddhist-esque shrine.
When we used to go there, we referred to the place as Cafe Dead.
Somewhere along the line it was noticed that this was a HEX number.
I was re-vamping some file format code and needed a couple of magic numbers: one for the persistent object file, and one for classes.
I used CAFEDEAD for the object file format, and in grepping for 4 character hex words that fit after “CAFE” (it seemed to be a good theme)
I hit on BABE and decided to use it. At that time, it didn’t seem terribly important or destined to go anywhere but the trash-can of history.
So CAFEBABE became the class file format, and CAFEDEAD was the persistent object format. But the persistent object facility went away,
and along with it went the use of CAFEDEAD - it was eventually replaced by RMI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>0xCAFEBABE</code> is <code>3405691582</code> in decimal.
If we sum all digits we get <code>43</code>. One more than <code>42</code> - <em>Ultimate Answer to the Life, the Universe, and Everything</em>.
By the way, <code>43</code> is a prime number. You see, magic everywhere. Even in the last sentence.</p>
